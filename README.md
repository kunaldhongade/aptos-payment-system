## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository and navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd payment-system
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

```bash
PROJECT_NAME=GlobalPaymentSystem
VITE_APP_NETWORK=testnet
VITE_MODULE_ADDRESS=0x28a4ba85d2158b999307af0ff676a986f1897b4a9c287b5ab3bbbea8636bb31e
```

Update the `VITE_MODULE_ADDRESS` if your contract is deployed to a different address.

### 4. Run the Development Server

Start the local server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

### 5. Deploy the Smart Contract

To deploy the smart contract:

1.  Install **Aptos CLI**.
2.  Update the **Move.toml** file with your wallet address:

    - Add you Wallet Address from Petra here

    ```bash
    sys_addrx = "0xca10b0176c34f9a8315589ff977645e04497814e9753d21f7d7e7c3d83aa7b57"
    ```

3.  Create your new Address for Deployment

    ```bash
    aptos init
    ```

    - Add your Account addr here for Deployment

    ```bash
    my_addrx = "28a4ba85d2158b999307af0ff676a986f1897b4a9c287b5ab3bbbea8636bb31e"
    ```
